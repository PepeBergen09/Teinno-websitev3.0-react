# Deployment Overview

This document provides an overview of deployment options and configurations for the Teinno Website v3.0 project.

## Deployment Platforms

### Primary: Coolify
- **Platform**: Self-hosted Coolify instance
- **Type**: Docker-based deployment
- **Guide**: [Coolify Deployment Guide](./coolify-deployment.md)
- **Features**: 
  - Automatic SSL certificates
  - Git-based deployments
  - Built-in monitoring
  - Environment management

### Alternative Platforms

#### Vercel
- Zero-config deployment for Vite applications
- Automatic HTTPS and global CDN
- Environment variable management
- Perfect for static React applications

#### Netlify
- Git-based continuous deployment
- Form handling and serverless functions
- Split testing and branch deploys
- Excellent for static sites

#### Docker-based Hosting
- Any VPS with Docker support
- Use provided Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- Manual but flexible deployment option

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- Local development server
- Hot module replacement
- Debug mode enabled
- Source maps included

### Test/Staging
- Production-like environment
- Limited analytics
- Debug mode for troubleshooting
- Staging domain

### Production
- Optimized build
- Analytics enabled
- Security headers
- Performance optimization
- Production domain

## Build Process

1. **Type Checking**: Validates TypeScript types
2. **Compilation**: Builds React application with Vite
3. **Optimization**: Minification, tree-shaking, code splitting
4. **Asset Processing**: Image optimization, CSS extraction
5. **Bundle Analysis**: Check bundle sizes and dependencies

## Security Considerations

- Environment variables for sensitive data
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular dependency updates

## Performance Optimization

- Code splitting by routes
- Lazy loading of components
- Image optimization
- Asset caching strategies
- CDN integration
- Compression (gzip/brotli)

## Monitoring and Alerts

- Application uptime monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- User analytics (when enabled)
- Server resource monitoring

## Backup and Recovery

- Source code in Git repository
- Environment configurations documented
- Database backups (if applicable)
- Disaster recovery procedures

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Testing
- Type checking
- Linting
- Unit tests (when added)
- Build verification

### Deployment Workflow
1. Code push to repository
2. Automated testing
3. Build creation
4. Environment deployment
5. Health checks
6. Monitoring activation

## Support and Maintenance

- Regular dependency updates
- Security patch management
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback integration
- Documentation updates

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env.production
npm install

# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Environment validation
node scripts/validate-env.js

# Docker deployment
